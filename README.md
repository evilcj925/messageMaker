# Mixed Messages (Codecademy Portfolio Project)

This project is given to us with very open ended instructions, and is designed to get us thinking about how we can use the concepts learned so far in interesting ways. 

## Project Objectives
The objectives given were as follows:
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub

## Setup 
To run this program, download this repository and run the whiskyNight.js file from the command line.

## Skills demonstrated
- Iteration over multiple arrays.
- Logic with handling duplicates in both arrays.

## Future changes?
It feels a bit messy. I believe I can streamline the code and achieve the same end result.
